##Getting and Cleaning Data
This is the Getting andd Cleaning Data Project/Week 3

#Description

In this project, the user tries to collect, work with, and clean a data setfrom the repository collected from Samsung Galaxy S smartphone accelerometers. First of all, user prepares a tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

It is required to submit: 
a) a tidy data set as described below
b) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
c) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

The data for the project is obtained from the url:

A R script called run_analysis.R must perform:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

In this repository people can find:

    CodeBook.md: information about raw and tidy data set
    README.md: this file
    run_analysis.R: R script to transform raw data set in a tidy one
